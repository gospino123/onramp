# Portfolio Projects

As part of a challenge found on [Onramp](https://onramp.io), this is an exercise on using Git to create a repository, stage changes, add commits, push a local repository to a remote repository, create merge conflicts and resolve merge conflicts.

## Projects
The following projects were completed as part of the curriculum for *The Odin Project* and *Codecademy*. The projects demonstrate use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

### [google](https://gospino123.github.io/portfolio-projects/google)
Using HTML5 and CSS3 concepts learned in *The Odin Project*, I created a replica of the **Google** search page. This was an early project where I focused on using CSS to mirror the behavior seen on the **Google** search page.

### [workAround](https://gospino123.github.io/portfolio-projects/workAround)
Focusing mostly on using modules in ES6 JS, I used broken or incomplete code provided by *Codecademy* to create a website that allows users to select specific roles and companies in the tech industry to view salaries, industry averages, company average salaries and industry averages across all roles and companies.

### [wanderlust](https://gospino123.github.io/portfolio-projects/wanderlust)
This *Codecademy* project involved using incomplete or broken code to achieve a working travel website using *Foursquare* and *OpenWeather* APIs to populate and render the top three attractions in a city as well as the current weather of that city.
